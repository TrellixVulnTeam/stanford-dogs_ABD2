# Stanford Dogs
I wrote a model to train on the stanford dogs, and also tried transfer learning with a
resnet50 model after that. The code for the transfer learning is almost the same as
from [this tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html),
with just very few changes.

I achieved an accuracy of 82.11% with the resnet50 model.
